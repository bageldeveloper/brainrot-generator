I was walking down the street when I heard a loud noise.
"""When I turned around to see what it was, I saw a man lying on the ground with his hands up and no sign of life."""
I quickly got my phone out and called 911 before continuing to walk away from the scene.
"""As soon as I walked away, the first thing that came into my mind was """"assistant""""."
"I had just finished eating lunch at a local restaurant when I heard someone screaming outside of their window."""
"""When I looked out the window, there were five men standing in front of me with guns pointed at them."""
"""They all had long hair and wore t-shirts that said """"assistant"""" on it."
"I quickly got my phone back and called 911 again before continuing to walk away from the scene."""
"""As soon as I walked away, the first thing that came into my mind was """"assistant""""."
"The men with guns were pointing at me when they said """"assistant"""" and then turned around and pointed their guns at me."""
They all had long hair too.
"""When I looked back to see where they were looking, there were no signs of them anywhere in sight."""
