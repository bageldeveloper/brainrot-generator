"I was always a gambling man, but I learned an important lesson that most gamblers quit before they win it big."
It's all about being humbled by failure.
The game of life is not one-size-fits-all.
"Some people can win at any given moment, while others are just waiting for the perfect time to strike.

Gambling has always been a part of my identity and I've learned that it's all about taking risks and not being afraid to fail."
The game is never over until you lose.
"This lesson was particularly applicable when I found myself in a difficult situation where I had to gamble with my life.

I woke up one morning, feeling like an idiot."
I knew that I could have been smarter or more resourceful but I didn't want to be the guy who lost his job because of his bad decision-making skills.
"The lesson here is simple: don't gamble with your life and never make a mistake in gambling.

I decided to take a step back from my daily routine, where I was constantly thinking about money and how much I could win at any given"
