Start now  
Snail tale  
Long ago  
Shells grew  
Soft inside  
Swirl shape  
Deep sea  
Forests too  
Still here  
Fossils show  
Old times  
Food, art  
Snail dye  
Gold worth  
Strong sign  
Slow pace  
Brainy kin  
Octopus!  
We learn  
From them  
They clean  
Feed life  
Help earth  
Snail farms  
Grow fast  
Ancient  
Modern  
Still slow  
Big tale  
Thanks all  
Shell yes!
