I remember the wildest
high school prank I ever
witnessed was when a
group of students at
my old school decided
to rig up some smoke
bombs in the cafeteria
during lunchtime. The
plan was to have everyone
believe that there was a
fire and evacuate the
building, but instead
of fleeing, they all just
lined up outside the
cafeteria doors, waiting
for the smoke to clear
so they could return
to their meals. It was
sheer madness, and I
couldn't believe my
eyes when I saw it happen
firsthand. The whole thing
was such a clusterfuck
that even the school
administration got
involved, and before
we knew it, the students
were facing consequences
for their actions. It was
a wild ride, to say the
least, but looking back,
I think it was worth it
in the end.
