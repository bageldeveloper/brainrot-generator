"""I was the baby of"
"the family, and my"
older brother had
always been favored
by our parents. He
got everything he
"wanted, including"
our dad's house. One
"day, I decided to"
take matters into my
own hands. I snuck
into our dad's
office and used his
credit card to buy a
new apartment for
myself and my
then-girlfriend. It
was the perfect plan
- until it all went
"horribly wrong."""
